### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.


From an availability and scalability prespective, VMs have a lot more flexibility, give you more control over the system, and have higher limit when it comes to performance. From a cost prespective as well as a workflow prespective an App Service is more convenient, as they have lower cost options compared to VMs and the workflow requires a lot less work from the user side given that an App service in a SaaS compared to VMs which are PaaS. 

Given the low complexity and usage of this app I'd suggest using an APP service because the cost are lower compared and workflow is easier to run and maintain.


If requirements were changed and now the app required to be much more scalable and required more computing power (Cores, RAM, etc.) I'd suggest VMs instead of App Service
